## Contributing
It is warmly welcomed if you have interest to contribute to `open-leaderboard` and help make it  better! The following is a set of guidelines for contributing .

### Submitting an issue

If you have any questions or feature requests, please feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/X-lab2017/open-leaderboard/issues/new/choose). Before you submit an issue:

- Please search for related issues. Make sure you are not going to open a duplicate issue.

- Please specify what kind of issue it is and explain it in the title or content, e.g. `feature`, `bug`, `documentation`, `discussion`, `help wanted`... 

To make the issue details as standard as possible, we set up an Issue Template for issue reporters. Please be sure to follow the instructions to fill fields in template.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. Check the issue list for unresolved issues, choose one you are interested in solving  and reply to  show your willingness to resolve the issue.
2. Proactively communicate with community maintainers under the issue for solutions.
3. Fork and clone the repository to local, and then you can develop the code locally.
4. Run `npm run prettier` to quickly format all your code.
5. Send a pull request on GitHub after you finish developing the code, and wait for the community maintainer to review the code.

To make sure we can easily recap what happened previously, we have prepared a pull request template. You need to fill out the PR template. If you feel that some part of the template is redundant and your description is clear enough, you can just keep the necessary parts.
